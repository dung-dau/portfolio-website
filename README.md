# Getting Started

A personal website I made using React, CSS and Firebase/Heroku for hosting. This project is available on https://ddau-8c279.web.app/ or https://ddau.herokuapp.com/.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
